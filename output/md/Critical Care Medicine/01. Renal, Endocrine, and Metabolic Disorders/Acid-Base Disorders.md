# [Acid-Base Regulation](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/11.%20Respiratory%20Anatomy%20%26%20Physiology/11.10%20Acid-Base%20Regulation.md)   
# General   
   
- Normal pH of normal saline = 5.5   
	- Salting Out   
	- Exposure of atmospheric CO₂ which diffuses into H₂O i.e. ionizes H₂O   
- Administration of normal saline causes acidosis   
	- dilution of [buffers](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/buffers.md) such as bicarbonate to form more carbonic acid   
	- NaCl results in more hydrogen ions → pushes equation to the left toward carbonic acid   
# Approach   
   
- Step 0: Required elements   
	- [ABG](/not_created.md) -- pH, PaCO₂, HCO3-   
	- Electrolytes -- Na+, Cl-, CO₂ (total = bicarbonate + total dissolved CO₂)   
	- Albumin   
	- Clinical History   
- Step 1: Establish internal consistency   
	- H+ = 24 x (PaCO₂/HCO3-); range +/- 2   
	- For pH range 7.25-7.55   
		- Change in pH by 0.01 equals change in H+ of 1 nmol/L in the opposite direction   
		- pH 7.4 = 40 nmol/L   
	- ABG nearly always consistent and if not internally consistent then needs to be repeated   
- Step 2: Evaluate pH   
	- Whether there is [acidemia](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/acidemia.md), [alkalemia](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/alkalemia.md) or normal   
- Step 3: Determine the primary process   
	- Evaluate the PaCO₂, HCO3-   
	- If pH change is from HCO3- → Metabolic   
		- [Metabolic Acidosis](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/Metabolic%20Acidosis.md)   
		- [Metabolic Alkalosis](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/Metabolic%20Alkalosis.md)   
	- if pH change is from PaCO₂ → Respiratory   
		- [Respiratory Acidosis](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/Respiratory%20Acidosis.md)   
		- [Respiratory Alkalosis](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/Respiratory%20Alkalosis.md)   
- Step 4: Calculate [Anion Gap](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/Anion%20Gap.md)   
- Step 5: Adjust Anion Gap for Albumin   
	- Albumin = single largest contributor to the normal anion gap   
	- When albumin is low -- decrease AG by 3 mmol/L for every 1 g/dL decrease in albumin from normal of 4 g/dL   
- Step 6: Calculate [Delta-Delta Gap](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/Delta-Delta%20Gap.md)   
- Step 7: Evaluate [Osmolar Gap](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/Osmolar%20Gap.md)   
- Step 8: Compensation & Finding Complex Acid-Base Disorders   
	- Rules of thumb   
		- Tends to normalize pH, never overcorrects   
		- Requires normal kidney and lung function   
		- Metabolic compensation takes 12-24 hours   
	- In simple disorders, PaCO₂ and HCO3- change in the same direction   
	- A change in pH = 0.08 in the opposite direction for every 10 mmHg change in PaCO₂ from 40 mmHg   
	- Compensation   
		- Metabolic acidosis -- expected PaCO₂ = (1.5 x HCO3-) + 8 +/- 2   
		- Metabolic alkalosis -- expected PaCO₂ = (0.7 x HCO3-) + 20 +/- 1.5   
		- Acute Respiratory Acidosis -- expected HCO3- = 1 **decrease** in HCO3- for every 10 increase in PaCO₂   
		- Acute Respiratory Alkalosis -- expected HCO3- = 2 **increase** in HCO3- for every 10 decrease in PaCO₂   
		- Chronic Respiratory Acidosis -- expected HCO3- = 4 **decrease** in HCO3- for every 10 increase in PaCO₂   
		- Chronic Respiratory Alkalosis -- expected HCO3- = 5 **increase** in HCO3- for every 10 decrease in PaCO₂   
	- Tip-offs to complex acid-base disorders   
		- Normal pH but abnormal PaCO₂ and HCO3-   
		- PaCO₂ and HCO3- move in opposite directions   
		- pH change opposite from primary disorder   
	- Finding Mixed Disorders   
		- Discern the primary disorder   
		- Evaluate compensation   
		- Evaluate [Delta-Delta Gap](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/Delta-Delta%20Gap.md)
