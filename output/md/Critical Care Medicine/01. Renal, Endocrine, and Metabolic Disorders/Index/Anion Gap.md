- Quantitates unmeasured anions   
- Every acid thats put into the system dissociates freely to let go of its hydrogen ion (e.g. lactic acid â†’ H+ + Lactate)   
- Specifically interested in anions of added acids (e.g. lactate, salicylates, ketoacids)   
- Cation (measured) + Cation (unmeasured) = Anion (measured) + Anion (unmeasured)   
	- Measured cation = Na+   
	- Measured anion = Cl-, HCO3-   
	- Na+ + Cation (unmeasured) = (Cl- + HCO3-) + Anion (unmeasured)   
	- Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-) =  Anion (unmeasured) - Cation (unmeasured)   
- Normal anion gap = 12   
- Should be calculated in every circumstance to uncover potentially hidden complex disorders
