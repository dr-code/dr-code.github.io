- Many acid anions remain in the extracellular fluid   
- Up to 50% of HCO3- buffered intracellularly and by bones   
- Delta-delta gap is the ratio of the change in [Anion Gap](../../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/Anion%20Gap.md) to the change of bicarbonate   
- Lactate poorly filtered and actively reabsorbed   
	- Delta-delta gap averages 1.6 (1.6:1)   
- Ketoacids readily eliminated in urine   
	- Delta-delta gap averages 1.0 (1:1)   
- Toluene → benzoic acid → hippuric acid: actively secreted   
	- Delta-delta gap averages <1.0 (<1:1)   
- Delta-Delta Gap also <1.0 (<1:1) in mixed HAGMA + NAGMA & in D-lactic acidosis   
- Delta-Delta Gap >1.6 = [Metabolic Alkalosis](../../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/Metabolic%20Alkalosis.md)
