- osmolality is miliosmoles per kg of weight   
- osmolarity is miliosmoles per L of volume   
- Osmometer measures osmolality but it reports osmolarity   
- Calculated osmolarity   
    - 2 Na + glucose/18 + BUN/2.8   
        - This is based on formula weight   
- osmolar gap: measured osmolarity - calculated osmolarity   
	- Normal osmolar gap is < 10 mosm/L   
# Increased Osmolar Gap with Acidosis   
   
- Methanol   
- Ethylene glycol   
- propylene glycol   
# Increased Osmolar Gap without Acidosis   
   
- Ethanol   
- Isopropanol   
- Acetone   
- Mannitol   
- Sorbitol   
# Normal Osmolar Gap   
   
- Lactate   
- Uremia   
- Salicylate   
- Ketoacids
