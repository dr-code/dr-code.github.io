# General   
   
- Definition: inability of the respiratory system to effectively carry out oxygenation and ventilation   
- Two categories: [Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/10.%20Pulmonary%20Disorders%20in%20Critical%20Care/Index/Hypoxemic%20Respiratory%20Failure.md) & [Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/10.%20Pulmonary%20Disorders%20in%20Critical%20Care/Index/Hypercapnic%20Respiratory%20Failure.md)   
	- [Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/10.%20Pulmonary%20Disorders%20in%20Critical%20Care/Index/Hypoxemic%20Respiratory%20Failure.md) = PaO₂ < 55 mmHg   
	- [Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/10.%20Pulmonary%20Disorders%20in%20Critical%20Care/Index/Hypercapnic%20Respiratory%20Failure.md) = PaCO₂ > 45 mmHg   
	- Both categories can be acute or chronic   
- Signs and symptoms of Acute Respiratory Failure   
	- Anxiety   
	- Accessory muscle use   
	- Diaphoresis   
	- After critical levels of [hypoxemia](/not_created.md) and [hypercapnia](/not_created.md) → encephalopathy & comatose   
	- Physical exam → respiratory distress 2/2 trying to overcome hypoxemia and hypercapnia → increased work of breathing   
- Signs and symptoms of Chronic Respiratory Failure   
	- No signs of suffering   
	- Chronically low PaO₂ → polycythemia   
	- Chronically high PaCO₂ → [Metabolic Alkalosis](../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/Metabolic%20Alkalosis.md)   
- Certain situations warrant the consideration of mixed states   
	- e.g. acute hypoxemia in the setting of chronic hypercapnia → pneumonia in someone with advanced emphysema   
		- In this patient, when they become acutely hypoxic, they will hyperventilate to increase PaO₂   
		- By hyperventilating, they will remove some CO₂ and therefore this will cause a pseudo-normalization of the PaCO₂   
		- This pseudo-normalization will accentuate the alkalosis   
	- Therefore in someone with hypoxia with unexplained metabolic alkalosis, consider underlying chronic lung disease
