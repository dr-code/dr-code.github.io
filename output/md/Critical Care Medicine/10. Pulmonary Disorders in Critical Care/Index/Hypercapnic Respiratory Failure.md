# Physiology of Gas Exchange   
# Overview of Hypercapnia   
   
- Definition of Hypercapnia   
	- PaCO₂ is directly proportional to rate of CO₂ production (VCO₂)   
	- PaCO₂ is inversely proportional to rate of CO₂ elimination by lung -- alveolar ventilation   
- Hypercapnia 2/2 increased CO₂ production (VCO₂)   
	- Increased metabolic rate   
		- Increased activity   
		- Sepsis   
		- Thyrotoxicosis   
	- Metabolizing of carbohydrates   
- Hypercapnia 2/2 decreased alveolar ventilation ($V_A$)   
	- Decreased minute ventilation   
	- Increased VD/VT (i.e. physiologic dead space) with stable minute ventilation   
	- Rapid, shallow breathing   
- Clinical Effects of Acute Hypercapnia   
	- Decreased level of consciouness   
		- PaCO₂ >60-70 mmHg in normal individuals   
		- PaCO₂ >90-100 mmHg in patients with chronic hypercapnia   
	- Increased cerebral blood flow, ICP   
	- Decreased myocardial contractility   
	- Decreased diaphragmatic function   
	- Shift oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the right

# Etiology of Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure   
   
- Broken link in the chain of events   
	- Central respiratory center → spinal cord → motor neurons → neuromuscular junction → respiratory muscles → chest wall → lung   
## Central Respiratory Drive   
   
- Decreased respiratory drive   
	- Sedative   
	- Opioid overdose   
	- Encephalitis   
	- Stroke   
		- Cheyne-Stokes Respiration   
			- Most common with heart failure, high altitude, and neurologic disease   
		- Biot Respiration   
			- Irregular clusters of breaths and apnea   
			- Lesion of upper pons or lower medulla   
	- Obesity hypoventilation syndrome   
	- Sleep apnea (central sleep apnea & obstructive sleep apnea)   
	- Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation   
	- Hypothyroidism   
		- Myxedema coma → depressed hypercapnic ventilatory drive & hypoxic ventilatory drive + respiratory muscle weakness & compromise of the upper airway   
	- [Metabolic Alkalosis](../../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/01.%20Renal%2C%20Endocrine%2C%20and%20Metabolic%20Disorders/Index/Metabolic%20Alkalosis.md)   
## Spinal Cord, Nerves, Neuromuscular Junction   
   
- Disorders of Spinal Cord   
	- Direct Spinal Cord Injury   
		- Traumatic spinal cord injury -- 50% of motor vehicle accidents, neurologic progression over hours   
		- Cervical spinal cord injury & respiratory muscles   
			- Phrenic nerve to diaphragm: C3-C5   
			- Scalene muscles: C4-C8   
			- Sternocleidomastoid, trapezius: C1-C4; CN XI   
		- Complete injury above C3 = ventilatory failure   
		- Injury at C3, C4, C5 -- often wean from ventilator   
	- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis   
		- Respiratory muscle weakness & progressive respiratory failure   
		- Combination of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron disease   
			- upper motor neuron -- degeneration -> [weakness](/not_created.md), [hyperreflexia](/not_created.md), [spasticity](/not_created.md)   
			- lower motor neuron -- degeneration -> [weakness](/not_created.md), [atrophy](/not_created.md), [fasciculation](/not_created.md)   
			- Involvement of bulbar nerves -- [Dysphagia](/not_created.md), [aspiration](/not_created.md), [laryngospasm](/not_created.md)   
	- Tetanus   
		- Caused by toxin-producing anaerobe Clostridium tetani   
		- Retrograde transport of exotoxin up axons to brainstem and spinal cord   
		- Blocks inhibitory neurotransmitters

## Respiratory Muscles & Chest Wall   
   
- Respiratory Muscle Weakness   
	- Etiology   
		- Pre-existing   
			- Neuromuscular junction   
			- Malnutrition   
			- Hyperinflation   
			- Endocrine   
				- Hyperthyroidism   
				- Hypothyroidism   
		- New-onset   
			- Metabolic   
				- Hypokalemia   
				- Hypophosphatemia   
				- Acidosis   
			- ICU-Acquired Weakness   
			- Mechanical ventilation   
	- Clinical features   
		- Decreased vital capacity   
		- Increased residual volume   
			- expiratory muscles → decreased expiratory reserve volume   
		- Decreased total lung capacity   
			- inspiratory muscles → decreased inspiratory capacity   
		- Further decrease in vital capacity when supine   
		- Decrease in maximum expiratory peak flow and maximum inspiratory peak flow   
		- Results in hypercapnia when strength is <40% predicted   
		- Desaturation, hypercapnia during REM sleep & in supine position   
- Disorders of the Chest Wall   
	- Results in decreased chest wall compliance & reduced tidal volume (increased VD/VT)   
	- Hypercapnia exacerbated by   
		- reduced ventilatory drive   
		- muscle weakness   
	- [Kyphoscoliosis](/not_created.md)   
		- Most patients with angle >90 degrees have hypercapnia   
	- [Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome](../../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/03.%20Sleep%20Medicine%2C%20Neuromuscular%2C%20and%20Skeletal/Obesity%20Hypoventilation%20Syndrome.md)   
		- Management of hypercapnic respiratory failure in morbid obese patients   
			- Identify and manage precipitating causes   
			- Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation   
				- improves ventilation → reduces work of breathing   
				- recruits atelectatic lung → improves V/Q matching → better oxygenation   
				- improves upper airway patency   
			- Head up (reverse Trendelenburg) position   
## Lung   
   
- Hypercapnic respiratory failure in patients with airflow obstruction   
- Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure 2/2 COPD   
	- Advanced COPD patients have a difficult time overcoming new infections like pneumonia   
	- Fever causes increased VCO₂ and/or increased VD (due to pneumonia) → increased minute ventilation (by increasing RR) → decreasing expiratory time and increasing air trapping → increased work of breathing, fatigue → acute respiratory failure   
	- Goal: rest, relief of air trapping   
		- Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation   
- Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure 2/2 status asthmaticus   
	- Development of dynamic hyperinflation   
		- Bronchospasm, airway inflammation, mucous plugging → airflow obstruction → prevents gas emptying   
		- New breath initiated before previous breath empties → increasing functional residual capacity   
		- Dynamic hyperinflation develops when the time needed to deflate the lung to normal FRC between breaths is insufficient   
			- i.e. auto-peep   
	- Effects of dynamic hyperinflation   
		- Moves diaphragm downward and at a mechanically disadvantageous position   
		- Incomplete alveolar gas emptying → elevated alveolar volume & alveolar pressure (intrinsic PEEP or auto-PEEP)   
		- Auto-PEEP represents a threshold pressure that must be overcome before inspiratory flow can occur → increasing work of breathing   
	- Ventilator adjustments for airflow obstruction   
		- Deliver adequate oxygenation   
		- Primary goal = increase expiratory time (i.e. time needed to exhale)   
		- Sedate patient to slow the respiratory rate   
		- Set lower RR -- most effective method   
		- Set lower tidal volume → less volume to exhale   
		- **Increase inspiratory flow rate to deliver air more rapidly thus more time for exhalation**   
# Capnography   
   
- Monitoring exhaled CO₂   
- Phases in measurement of exhaled CO₂   
	- Phase 1: no exhaled CO₂ -- end inspiration to early exhalation of dead space gas from proceeding breath   
	- Phase 2: rise in exhaled CO₂ during the mixing of dead space gas and emptying of alveoli with transition to   
	- Phase 3: reflects the alveolar plateau as alveoli empty, reaching a maximum exhaled CO₂ immediately prior to   
	- Phase 4: the rapid fall in CO₂ during inspiration   
	- ![](../../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/10.%20Pulmonary%20Disorders%20in%20Critical%20Care/Index/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220518133812.png)   
- Angles   
	- The α angle represents the angle formed between Phase 2 and Phase 3; normally 110 degrees   
		- Variations in this angle is linked to variations in time constants within the different alveolar units and thus overall V/Q status   
		- Other factors that affect this angle: cardiac output, airway resistance, and changes in FRC   
- Clinical Utility of Capnography   
	- Confirmation of endotracheal tube placement   
	- Continuous monitoring (loss of exhaled CO₂ = displaced ETT)   
	- Perfusion during CPR -- effectiveness of resuscitation, ROSC   
	- Detection of hypoventilation, bradypnea, apnea, and reverse I:E ventilation (shorter time during exhalation)   
	- In [Asthma](../../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Airways/Asthma.md)/[Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease](../../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Airways/Chronic%20Obstructive%20Pulmonary%20Disease.md) → uneven alveolar emptying and V/Q mismatch → "Shark-Fin" contour representing airflow obstruction   
		- ![](../../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/10.%20Pulmonary%20Disorders%20in%20Critical%20Care/Index/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220208114516.png)   
	- Gap between arterial and end-tidal CO₂ is usually negligible in healthy nonintubated patients (usually around 2 to 5 mmHg) - P(a-ET)CO₂   
		- Cardiac and respiratory pathologies can increase this gap and this can be used to estimate alveolar dead space ventilation   
		- In conditions such as acute pulmonary embolism, a precipitous drop of end-tidal CO₂ will happen and if the PaCO₂ remains constant, this leads to a significant increase in P(a-ET)CO₂   
		- Normalization of this gap has been shown as a positive prognostic sign when seen after re-perfusion from tPA   
		- Other causes of increased P(a-ET)CO₂   
			- Hypovolemia   
			- Hemorrhage   
			- Excessive PEEP   
			- Early ARDS -- independent risk factor for death   
		- Negative P(a-ET)CO₂   
			- Uncommon → verify the validity of the values from capnopgraph and ABG   
			- Etiologies:   
				- low frequency and high tidal volume ventilation   
				- post CABG   
				- post exercise   
				- pregnant   
				- pediatric patients
