# Physiology of Gas Exchange   
# Overview of Hypoxemia   
   
- Impairment of perfusion and the matching of ventilation and perfusion results in Hypoxemia   
- Principle mechanisms of hypoxemic respiratory failure can be separated into intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary factors

- Extrapulmonary Factors     
	- High Altitude   
		- Low partial pressure of inspired oxygen (PIO₂) which reduces oxygen content (e.g. high altitude -- above 8000 feet) → results in hyperventilation → lower PaCO₂   
		- [A-a gradient](/not_created.md) is normal and therefore the lung function is normal   
			- $P_{AO_{2}} - P_{aO_{2}} = F_{IO_{2}}(P_{atm}-P_{H_{2}O})-P_{aCO_{2}}/R - P_{aO_{2}}$   
			- R = the respiratory exchange ratio $(\dot{V}_{O_{2}}/\dot{V}_{CO_{2}})$   
				- $\dot{V}_{O_{2}}$ = Oxygen consumption   
				- $\dot{V}_{CO_{2}}$ = Carbon dioxide production   
		- Decrease in $F_{IO_{2}}$ or $P_{atm}$ via travel to altitude will functionally decrease $P_{AO_{2}}$ and lead to hypoxemia despite normal lung function   
	- Low Cardiac Output   
		- Low oxygen delivery to the tissues as a result of low cardiac output resulting in tissue hypoxia → generation of lactic acid (supply/demand mismatch)   
			- normal oxygen content    
			- due to the tissues wanting more oxygen, it will be extracted by the tissues more and the amount of deoxygenated blood returning to the lung is higher   
				- If normal lungs then this is rapidly re-oxygenated   
				- If impairment in lung oxygenation, blood leaving the lungs may not be fully oxygenated   
			- DO₂  Cardiac Output x Carrying Capacity   
				- = Cardiac Output x {(Hb x %saturation of Hb x 1.34  PaO₂ x 0.003   
				- Carrying capacity is equivalent to oxygen content   
- Intrapulmonary Factors   
	- Shunt   
		- <inclusion href="Shunt.svg" />   
		- Perfusion without accompanying ventilation -- can be structural or physiological   
		- Structural Shunt   
				- Intracardiac   
					- right-to-left communication -- PFO, PDA, ASD, VSD   
				- Intrapulmonary   
					- abnormal connection between pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins -- AVM   
				- Differentiate between intracardiac and intrapulmonary shunts   
					- Contrast echo w/ air bubbles injected into the venous circulation and visualized in the left atrium   
						- Timing differentiates between intracardiac and intrapulumonary   
						- Intracardiac -- within 1 to 3 cardiac cycles   
						- Intrapulmonary -- within 6 to 8 cardiac cycles   
		- Physiologic Shunt   
			- Found in states of dense alveolar filling or collapse   
				- atelectasis or compresive atelectasis (due to abdomen or pleural effusion)   
				- Pneumothorax   
				- Central airway obstruction   
			- In these conditions, hypoxic vasoconstriction reduces much of the blood flow through the nonaerated lung zones but not completely leaving areas of perfusion without ventilation   
	- V/Q Mismatch   
		- Spectrum of diseases   
			- ![](../../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/10.%20Pulmonary%20Disorders%20in%20Critical%20Care/Index/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220520084452.png)   
		- Most common cause of [Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure](../../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/10.%20Pulmonary%20Disorders%20in%20Critical%20Care/Index/Hypoxemic%20Respiratory%20Failure.md)   
		- Optimal gas exchange is based on maximally matching ventilation and perfusion that is, a V/Q ratio equal to 1   
		- In a healthy patient, V/Q ratio is not uniform in the lung but the summation of the 300 million alveoli in a normal distribution around a V/Q ratio equal to 1   
		- In disease states, regional mismatching of ventilation and perfusion leads to ineffective gas exchange   
			- Regional vascular dropout   
				- Emphysema or large pulmonary embolism → high V/Q (nearing dead space physiology) → hypercapnia   
			- Patchy alveolar filling → low V/Q state (nearing shunt physiology)   
		- Common conditions associated with abnormal V/Q matching   
			- Pneumonia   
				- Alveoli fill with purulent material over time → disrupt basement membrane and cellular tight junctions → disruption in alveolar ventilation → low V/Q → hypoxia   
			- Cardiogenic pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure   
				- Fluid accumulation in the interstitium and alveolus due to disruption in the direction and rate of fluid exchange due to left heart issues   
				- Left heart issues → elevated left atrial pressure → capillary hydrostatic changes → fluid accumulation in the interstitium   
				- Hypoxemia in CHF = multifactorial   
					- Early on the interstitial fluid causes a diffusion abnormality & low V/Q   
						- Diffusion abnormality   
							- interstitial fluid → diffusion abnormality → hypoxemia   
						- Low V/Q   
							- interstitial fluid → decrease in lung compliance → regional decline in ventilation → Low V/Q   
							- interstitial fluid → narrowing of the airways surrounding this region → decline in ventilation → Low V/Q (classic cardiac wheeze on physical examination)   
					- Later → alveolar flooding → low V/Q areas convert to shunt physiology → progressive hypoxemia   
			- Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and [Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome](../../../Critical%20Care%20Medicine/10.%20Pulmonary%20Disorders%20in%20Critical%20Care/Index/Acute%20Respiratory%20Distress%20Syndrome.md)   
				- Fluid accumulation in the interstitium and alveolus due to disruption in the direction and rate of fluid exchange due to changes in oncotic pressure and/or capillary permeability   
				- Oncotic pressure changes and/or capillary permeability changes → leak of protein and fluid accumulation in the interstitium   
				- Appearance of classic hyaline membranes lining the alveoli   
				- Hypoxemia in ARDS = multifactorial   
					- Early → increased permeability & fluid extravasation → low V/Q   
					- Later → atelectatic lungs from low ventilation in dependent lungs & overdistention in anterior portions of lungs   
						- Chest wall restrictions of posterior ribs → decreased compliance   
						- Pooling of fluid and exudate in posterior lungs → decreased ventilation   
	- Diffusion block   
		-    
	- Alveolar Hypoventilation   
		- Final common pathway for all causes of respiratory distress   
	- Alveolar filling processes caused by pneumonia, ARDS, alveolar hemorrhage, CHF usually affect the lung in a heterogenous fashion therefore have both shunt and V/Q mismatch contributing to the hypoxemia
