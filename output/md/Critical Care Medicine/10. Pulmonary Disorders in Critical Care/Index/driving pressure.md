- Definition: pressure change across alveolar structures required to deliver a tidal volume   
- $\Delta$P = plateau pressure - PEEP = VT/Respiratory System compliance   
- This approach allows us to adjust tidal volume based on the compliance rather than by *ideal* body weight   
	- Tidal volume based on ideal body weight may overdistend areas of the lung that are normal due to reduced ventilation-capable parts of the lung (dense consolidation)   
- Driving pressure was associated with survival   
	- $\Delta$ P $\geq$ 19 cm Hâ‚‚O had increased risk of hospital death
