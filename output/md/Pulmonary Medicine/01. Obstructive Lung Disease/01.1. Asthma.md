# General Information   
   
- Definition: heterogenous & chronic inflammatory disorder of airways characterized by **hyperreactivity (hyperresponsiveness) of the airways** causing airway narrowing due to exaggerated response of airway smooth muscle contraction (due to a wide variety of stimuli) leading to **reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction** and therefore **variable expiratory airflow limitation**   
	- hyperresponsiveness of airways due to exaggerated smooth muscle contraction —> bronchoconstriction that is reversible —> variable expiratory airflow limitation   
- Exacerbations happen interspersed between intervals of diminished symptoms or symptom-free period

## Risk Factors   
   
- Strongest risk factor = family history of allergy — estimates of heritability range from 35-70% (higher for early-onset asthma)   
	- inc risk of developing allergic rhinitis   
	- inc risk of developing asthma   
	- **Serum IgE correlates strongly with bronchial hyperresponsiveness**   
	- Association with gene variants at Ch 17q21 locus — a/w childhood asthma not adult-onset; genes GSDMB & ORMDL3   
- Other risk factors   
	- Specific allergens: House dust mites, dog and cat dander, cockroach — controlling these is part of the treatment of asthma   
	- Early life infections   
		- Hygiene hypothesis —protective effect   
            - rise in allergies in children is an unintended consequence of the success of domestic hygiene in reducing the rate of infections or exposure to bacterial products in early childhood   
            - essentially due to the improved hygiene you have less exposure to allergens and bacteria (exposure to this is supposed to promote Th1 immunity (cellular defense) → which is responsible for blunting Th2 immunity)   
		- Increase risk for wheezing illnesses and asthma over time as a result of viral respiratory infections (RSV and Rhinovirus)   
            - exposure early in life leads to asthma   
            - unclear whether its a direct causation or whether it unmasks a predisposition to predominant Th2 like responses   
            - if those children develop lower respiratory infections due to RSV and Rhino they are at 3-4-fold risk of subsequent wheezing during early school years   
            - Early wheezing = age <3; persistent wheezing = present at age 6   
                - Early wheezing — a/w RSV and Rhino → can become persistent (this is due to atopy) or can be transient (this is due to maternal smoking)   
                - Late-onset wheezing — starts at age 6 — also due to atopy   
        - children who lived in farms had a lower prevalence   
    - Atypical Bacterial Infections   
        - Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumoniae   
            - infect the airway epithelium → stimulate local inflammatory reactions   
            - more common in the airway of patients with chronic stable asthma   
            - a/w increase in tissue mast cells   
        - lower airway biospecimens from asthmatics show abnormalities in the composition of bacterial microbiota, especially Proteobacteria (which include H. influenzae, Pseudomonas, Neisseria, Burkholderia species, and Enterobacteriaceae species.   
            - Notably, Proteobacterial species promote neutrophilic inflammation, and there is now great interest in whether specific microbial pathogens drive specific subtypes of asthma (such as neutrophilic asthma)   
    - Intrauterine exposures   
        - growth rates — both high and low   
        - dietary vitamins D and E deficiency; vitamin D plays a role in immunoregulation   
        - exposure to microbial products   
        - parental smoking   
        - parental stress   
    - Perinatal Risk Factors   
	    - prematurity   
	    - chorioamnionitis   
   - Early Childhood Risk Factors   
	   - shorter breastfeeding period   
	   - obesity   
	   - absence of older siblings or daycare attendance (i.e. exposure to other children)   
	   - antibiotic use   
	   - acetaminophen use (esp when given in 1st year of life; ? dose dependent)   
	   - Bacteroides fragilis colonization at age 3 weeks is a/w increased risk of asthma   
	   - upper airway colonization in infants by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis predicts later development of asthma   
    - Air pollution   
	    - no data to suggest that air pollution can contribute to the development of asthma   
	    - however increased prevalence in those with proximity to heavy automobile traffic due to exposure of particulate matter and NO2   
	- Occupational exposures   
		- accounts for 17% of adult-onset asthma   
		- can be immunologically mediated sensitization to occupational agents — sensitizer-induced occupational asthma   
		- or exposure to high concentrations of irritant compounds — irritant-induced occupational asthma   
## Natural History   
   
- Atopic/Allergic March   
    - pattern of atopic dz during infancy and childhood that begins with atopic dermatitis or eczema in the 1st year of life (+/- food allergy) then progresses to development of rhinoconjunctivitis then asthma later in life   
- Teenage Years   
    - starting in puberty, asthma changes from male predominance to female predominance (which continues into adulthood)   
    - ? hormonal component   
- Remission   
    - R/F a/w greater likelihood of persistence into adulthood — sensitization to house dust mites, lower FEV1, airway hyperresponsiveness, female gender, and smoking at the age of 21   
    - data to suggest that the inflammatory response really never goes away even in patients in "remission" (elevated Fraction of NO, bronchial bx show eosinophils, T cells, mast cells, and increased subepithelial fibrosis)   
- Progressive Airflow Obstruction   
    - Deposition of collagen and growth of vessels, smooth muscle, secretory cells and glands → progressive narrowing of airways in chronic asthma   
- Adulthood   
    - many had symptoms as a child   
    - can be de novo — usually after an acute URI   
- Elderly   
    - if asthma presents as an adult it will continue later in life   
    - elderly patients more likely to have fixed airway obstruction compared to children   
## Pathogenesis   
### Mechanisms of Asthma   
![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/2022-04-24%20Asthma_Pathogenesis_%281%29.png)   
### Phenotypes   
   
- What we call asthma may not represent a single disease process but rather the summation of a number of pathogenetic pathways (endotypes) that have differences in expression (phenotype) w/ common features being airway inflammation and episodic bronchoconstriction   
    - Phenotype — observable characteristics that result from a combination of hereditary and environmental influences.   
    - Endotype — distinct mechanistic/molecular pathway leading to a certain phenotype   
    - Biomarker — a measurable indicator of presence or severity of a disease state   
    - ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/2022-04-24%20Asthma_%281%29.png)   
- Th2-High   
    - increased expression of IL-13 & IL-5   
    - exaggerated airway hyperresponsiveness — methacholine   
    - higher serum IgE levels   
    - higher eosinophils (blood and BAL eosinophilia) (>3%)   
    - increased thickness of fibrosis below the airway epithelial BM   
    - Increased MUC5AC/MUC5B ratio → increased expression in goblet cells   
    - Increased number of intra-epithelial mast cells   
- Th2-Low   
    - i.e. non-Th2   
    - driven by Th1 & Th17 → airflow obstruction & exacerbation   
    - Th1   
        - IFN-gamma dependent airway hyperresponsiveness → corticosteroid resistance   
    - Th17   
        - IL-17, IL-21, IL-22 but not IFN-gamma or IL-4   
        - most parenchymal cells (including airway epithelial cells) express receptors for Th17 cytokines → IL-17 → production of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-16, IL-1, TNF-a & IL-8 (which attracts neutrophils))   
            - IL-17 → increases epithelial production of secreted mucins   
        - Th17 → steroid resistance   
    - **Airway inflammation does not play a dominant role in clinical manifestations in Th2-low rather a result of abnormal ASM response** (contraction by histamine and ACh)   
    - Paucigranulocytic asthma — most common phenotype in stable asthma; 20% can be severe/refractory   
- Polymorphism in:   
    - IL-4, IL-13 genes — allergies and IgE   
    - CD14 & TLR genes — farming and endotoxin exposure   
    - TGF-B1, MCP-1 — fibrosis/remodeling   
    - Gene for the B chain of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FCER1B) — allergies   
    - B-receptor (Arg/Arg) and glucocorticoid polymorphism determine heterogeneity in treatment response —> mutation causes down regulation of B2 receptors decreasing response to treatment   
### Mechanisms of Asthma Exacerbation   
   
- exacerbations represents acute on chronic worsening of airflow obstruction due to worsening airway smooth muscle contraction, airway wall edema, and luminal obstruction with mucus   
- repeated airway remodeling → susceptibility to acute reductions in airflow   
- changes in epithelium → increase mucin stores → mucus hypersecretion → more hyperreactive   
- changes in airway smooth muscle → concentric smooth muscle contraction → more hyperreactive   
- changes in blood vessels → increased permeability → vulnerable to exaggerated airway responses to inhaled environmental insults → worsening mucosal edema → more hyperreactive   
## Pathology   
   
- structural changes in epithelium and submucosa   
- Edema (from Nitric Oxide) and cellular infiltrates within the bronchial wall, esp with eosinophils and lymphocytes   
- Epithelial Changes   
    - Main Changes   
        - Goblet Cell Metaplasia & Hyperplasia   
            - increasing amount of gel-forming mucins that are stored in the airway epithelium   
        - Epithelial damage, with a "fragile" appearance of the epithelium and detachment of surface epithelial cells from basal cells   
    - Less Common Changes   
        - Desquamation — acute severe asthma exacerbation (not chronic stable asthma)   
        - Squamous metaplasia — usually seen in smoking-related lung injury not asthma   
- Airway Mucus Changes   
    - Higher mucin concentration than normal   
        - MUC5AC upregulation in epithelial cells and MUC5B downregulation   
    - Presence of albumin — prominent protein in asthma   
        1.  reflects increased vascular permeability (esp in acute exacerbations)   
        2.  albumin + other proteins + mucin → increase mucus viscosity   
5.  Subepithelial Fibrosis   
   
    - Increased amounts of types I, III, and V collagen + fibronectin and tenascin → deposited immediately underneath the epithelium (which means underneath the basement membrane)   
    - Recall BM is made up of collage IV and laminin so this is underneath the BM layer   
    - source of these collagens are the epithelial cells and myofibroblasts (which are increased in number in asthma)   
    - more prominent in Type 2 Eosinophilic asthma   
    - Due to the stiffness of the matrix, it causes persistent activation of overlying epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells → bronchoconstriction   
- Airway Smooth Muscle Cells   
    - Mild-moderate asthma — hyperplasia of ASM   
    - Severe asthma — hypertrophy + hyperplasia of ASM   
    - increased shortening → affects elastance   
- Blood vessels   
    - Quantity and size increases   
    - Increase in vascular volume → mucosal swelling → narrowing of airway lumen   
    - all due to increased permeability from vasodilation   
- Airway Pathology in Fatal Cases of Asthma   
    - severe concentric smooth muscle contractions + extensive mucus plugging → segmental and subsegmental lung collapse   
    - greater airway wall thickening, ASM hypertrophy (leads to bumps on the airway) and submucosal gland hypertrophy
