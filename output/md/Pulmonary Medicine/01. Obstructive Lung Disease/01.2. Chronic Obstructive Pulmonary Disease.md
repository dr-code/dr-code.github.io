# General Information   
   
- Definition: **persistent airflow limitation** that is usually progressive and is associated with a chronic enhanced inflammatory response in the airways and lungs to noxious particles and gases   
	- due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities   
- Common, preventable & treatable disease   
- Usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases   
	- Developed countries — smoking; developing countries — biomass fuel   
- Influenced by host factors including abnormal lung development   
- Chronic bronchitis — clinical diagnosis — chronic cough and sputum production   
	- epidemiological definition — chronic productive cough on most days during at least 3 months per year for 2 or more consecutive years   
	- periods of worsening or exacerbation precipitated by a respiratory tract infection   
	- in between exacerbations, residual clinical disease (unlike asthma where symptoms go away in between exacerbations) because chronic bronchitis is not a disease of airway hyperreactivity   
	- If clinical features of chronic bronchitis with evidence of airway hyperreactivity → asthmatic bronchitis or asthma-COPD overlap syndrome   
- Emphysema — pathological diagnosis — destruction of lung parenchyma and enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchiole — this is the region from respiratory bronchioles to the alveoli   
	- where the destruction is along this path determines the subtype of emphysema   
- Chronic bronchitis and emphysema can (and often do) co-exist in a patient therefore the broader term of COPD is used   
- Significant comorbidities may have an impact on morbidity and mortality   
# Associated Anatomy & Physiology   
# Epidemiology   
## Burden of COPD   
### COPD is underdiagnosed and under-reported   
   
- Prevalence estimates vary widely   
	- Global -- 10.1%   
- Deaths -- 3.2 million annually   
	- Third leading cause of death worldwide   
- Prevalence expected to rise over next 4 decades   
- Prevalence increasing in women   
- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503101718.png)   
	- China and India account for more than 50% of all cases of COPD in the world   
- Undiagnosed COPD   
	- Percentage of undiagnosed COPD in the general population, aged 40 or older with current or past exposure to tobacco (≥10 pack-years) is 70-78%   
	- Overall health system burden by undiagnosed COPD still exists and its largely unrecognized   
	- Asymptomatic Undiagnosed COPD   
		- If FEV₁ <80% (moderate or more severe obstruction) → adverse effects ~ symptomatic COPD   
		- Increased risk of exacerbations and pneumonia   
	- Symptomatic Undiagnosed COPD   
		- increased risk of exacerbations, pneumonia and death   
	- i.e. it doesn't matter if they are symptomatic or not, being undiagnosed increases risk of adverse effects   
# Etiology, Pathogenesis & Pathology   
## Etiology & Risk Factors   
   
- Early life factors and exposures   
	- Maternal smoking   
	- Respiratory infections   
	- Dysanapsis (Mismatch of airway tree caliber to lung size; develops early in life)   
- Tobacco smoke   
	- Nearly 80% of all COPD cases can be attributed to smoking   
	- **15-20% of 1 pack per day (PPD) smokers and 25% of 2 PPD smokers will develop COPD**   
- Outdoor and Indoor Pollution   
	- Biomass fuel   
		- **50% of COPD deaths in developing countries are from biomass smoke**   
		- 75% are in women   
- Occupational exposures   
	- May account for 15-20% of COPD   
	- **Mining**, agriculture, textile, paper, wood, chemical, food processing   
	- **Cadmium fumes can cause emphysema (smelting, batteries)**   
- Socioeconomic status   
- Genetic factors   
	- Several GWAS (genome-wide association study) have linked genetic loci with COPD but causality remains uncertain   
	- **Best documented in Alpha-I Antitrypsin Deficiency**   
		- ***SERPINA1*** gene mutation   
   
### Lung Function Trajectory   
   
- Reduced maximal attained lung function may identify individuals at increased risk   
- Incidence of COPD was higher when FEV1 was <80% predicted before age 40 (26% vs 7%; P <0.001)   
- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503102438.png)   
	- TR1: Normal   
	- TR2: Small lungs but no COPD   
	- TR3: Normal initial FEV₁ with rapid decline leading to COPD   
	- TR4: Small lungs leading to COPD   
### Dysanapsis   
   
- Associated with incident COPD in older adults   
- Develops early in life    
- May contribute to COPD susceptibility later in life   
- Three trials -- MESA (N=2531), CanCOLD (N=1272), SPIROMICS (N=2726)   
- Incidence and prevalence of COPD was highest in the lowest airway to lung ratio quartiles in MESA and CanCOLD   
- SPIROMICS participants with COPD in the highest airway to lung ratio quartiles had faster FEV₁ decline as compared to the lowest airway to lung ratio quartile suggesting two different paths for COPD development   
- Can lead to [Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/Index/Tracheobronchial%20Diseases.md#bronchopulmonary-dysplasia)   
### Risk Factors for AECOPD   
   
- Advanced age   
- Severity of airflow limitation   
- Chronic mucous hypersecretion   
- Productive cough   
- Duration of COPD   
- Pulmonary Hypertension (Pulmonary Artery {PA}: Ascending Aorta {A} ratio >1)   
- Blood eosinophil count >340 cells/μL   
- [Comorbid Conditions](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/01.2.%20Chronic%20Obstructive%20Pulmonary%20Disease.md#^4e379d)   
- GERD   
- History of antibiotic use   
- COPD-related hospitalization in the previous year   
	- **History of prior exacerbations is the single best predictor, regardless of severity**   
### Etiology of AECOPD   
   
- Causes of exacerbations requiring hospitalization in patients (Papi A, et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2006;173:1114)   
	- Non-infectious 21.8%   
	- Bacteria 29.7%   
	- Virus 23.4%   
	- Bacteria & Virus 25%   
## Pathogenesis   
   
- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503104055.png)   
### Inflammation in COPD   
   
- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503104157.png)   
#### T Lymphocytes   
   
- Increase in T lymphocytes in the airway wall and lung parenchyma   
	- organize into lymphoid follicles   
	- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503104319.png)   
		- Collection of bronchial lymphoid tissue with a lymphoid follicle containing a germinal center (GC) surrounded by a rim of darker-staining lymphocytes that extend to the epithelium of both the small airway and alveolar surface   
	- Shift in the balance of CD4/CD8 T cell ratio in favor of CD8 → direct toxic effects → alveolar wall destruction   
- Number of Th1 and Tc1 cells, which produce interferon-γ increase   
#### Neutrophils   
   
- Release proteases   
- Increased in the sputum and distal airspaces of smokers   
- Further increase occurs in COPD and is related to disease severity   
#### Macrophages   
   
- Produce inflammatory mediators and proteases   
- Increased in number in airway, lung parenchyma and in BAL fluid   
#### B Lymphocytes   
   
- increased in peripheral airways and within lymphoid follicles possibly as a response to chronic infection of the airways   
#### Inflammatory Mediators   
   
- Leukotriene B4   
	- Chemoattractant of neutrophils and T cells   
	- produced by macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells   
- Chemotactic factors (CXC) & Chemokines (IL-8 & growth related oncogene α)   
	- produced by macrophages and epithelial cells   
	- Chemoattractant of cells from circulation and amplify pro-inflammatory responses   
- TNF-α & IL 1β + IL 6 -- Pro-inflammatory cytokines   
- TGF-β -- growth factors   
	- may cause fibrosis in the airways either directly or through release of another cytokine, connective tissue growth factor   
#### Protease and Antiprotease Imbalance   
   
- Increased production (or activity) of proteases and decreased production (or inactuvation) of antiproteases = imbalance   
- Cigarette smoke + inflammation → oxidative stress → primes inflammatory cells → release of proteases and inactivates several antiproteases by oxidation   
	- Oxidative stress   
		- leads to inactivation of antiproteases & stimulation of mucous production   
		- Amplifies inflammation by enhancing transcription factor activation (NFκB) → gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators   
- Main proteases involved   
	- Neutrophil produced -- serine proteases, elastase, cathepsin G, and protease 3   
	- Macrophage produced -- cysteine proteases, cathepsins E, A, L, and S   
	- Matrix metalloproteases -- MMP-8, MMP-9, and MMP-12   
- Main antiproteases involved   
	- α1 antitrypsin   
	- secretory leukoprotease inhibitor   
	- tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases   
- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/2022-05-03%20COPD02.f7.jpg)   
#### HDAC expression is reduced in COPD   
   
- Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2 suppresses inflammatory gene experssion   
- Corticosteroids can recruit HDAC and reverse inflammatory process   
- HDAC function is impaired by cigarette smoking and oxidative/nitrative stress   
- HDAC levls in the lung decrease with increasing COPD severity   
- In COPD, there is decreased corticosteroid responsiveness   
### α-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) Deficiency   
   
- AAT is a protease inhibitor of the proteolytic enzyme elastase   
- An imbalance between neutrophil elastase and the elastase inhibitor causes early COPD in smokers (see above)   
- COPD occurs later in non-smokers   
- Inherited in autosomal co-dominant pattern   
	- SERPINA1 gene on Chromosome 14   
	- M allele is normal   
	- S or Z allele a/w deficiency   
- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503104924.png)   
- Consider AAT if   
	- earlier age of onset (<45 years)   
	- emphysema in a nonsmoker or minimal smoker   
	- Basal, pan-acinar emphysema   
	- Unremitting asthma with persistent airflow limitation   
	- Concurrent liver disease/cirrhosis   
	- Necrotizing panniculitis   
	- C-ANCA positive vasculitis   
	- First-degree relative with emphysema, bronhiectasis, panniculitis   
### Exacerbation-Prone COPD   
   
- Imaging phenotypes (Han MK, et al. Radiology 2011;261(1):274)   
	- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503120342.png)   
- COPDGene Study   
	- Greater lung emphysema and airway wall thickness a/w COPD exacerbations, **independent of the severity of airflow obstruction**   
# Pathophysiology   
## Mucus Hypersecretion & Ciliary Dysfunction   
### Mucus Hypersecretion   
   
- Results in chronic productive cough   
	- Characteristic of chronic bronchitis but not necessarily a/w airflow obstruction   
- Not all patients with COPD have symptomatic mucous hypersecretion   
- Hypersecretion is due to    
	- squamous metaplasia   
	- increased # of goblet cells   
	- increased size of bronchial submucosal glands in response to chronic irritation by noxious particles and gases   
### Ciliary Dysfunction   
   
- Ciliary Dysfunction due to   
	- squamous metaplasia of epithelial cells   
		- Abnormal mucociliary escalator   
		- Difficulty in expectorating   
## Airflow Limitation & Air Trapping (Hyperinflation)   
   
- Inflammation, fibrosis, and luminal exudates occur in small airways (<2 mm in diameter)   
	- This is because of inflammation and narrowing (airway remodeling) and inflammatory exudates in the small airways   
- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503105202.png)   
- Number of small airways is decreased   
	- smoking-related or may reflect abnormal early-life lung development   
	- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503105334.png)   
		- Hogg J. Lancet 2004; 364: 709–21   
- Other factors -- loss of lung elastic recoil (due to destruction of alveolar walls) and destruction of alveolar support (from alveolar attachments)   
- **Hyperinflation occurs early in the disease and is the main mechanism of exertional dyspnea**   
	- The progressive airway obstruction traps air during expiration resulting in   
		- hyperinflation at rest   
		- dynamic hyperinflation during exercise   
	- Reduces inspiratory capacity → reduction in FRC during exercise → breathlessness & limited exercise capacity   
## Emphysema & Gas Exchange Abnormalities   
   
- Peribronchiolar destruction of alveolar walls   
- Loss of alveolar attachments   
- Loss of elastic recoil and airway collapse   
- Enlargement of air spaces   
### Subtypes of Emphysema   
   
- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503112545.png)   
### Gas Exchange Abnormalities   
   
- Gas exchange abnormalities occur in advanced disease   
	- Arterial hypoxemia with or without hypercapnia   
		- Anatomical changes in COPD → abnormal distribution of V/Q ratios → abnormal gas exchange   
	- Extent of impairment of DLCO per liter of alveolar volume correlates well with the severity of emphysema   
## Pulmonary Hypertension   
   
- Develops late in COPD at the time of severe gas exchange abnormalities   
	- Hypoxia → pulmonary arterial constriction   
	- Structural change in pulmonary arterioles   
		- Endothelial dysfunction   
		- Remodeling of pulmonary arteries (smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia)   
		- Destruction of pulmonary capillary bed   
- Hypoxia + Structural changes in pulmonary arterioles → persistent pulmonary hypertension & right ventricular hypertrophy or enlargement and dysfunction (cor pulmonale)   
- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/2022-05-03%20copD02.f8.jpg)   
## Systemic Effects   
   
- Systemic inflammation + skeletal muscle wasting → limited exercise capacity   
	- worsen prognosis irrespective of degree of airflow obstruction   
- Increased risk of CV disease → a/w increase in CRP (see below)   
## Exacerbation Pathophysiology   
   
- Increased neutrophilic inflammation & increased number of eosinophils (in mild exacerbations)   
- Caused by infection, air pollution, and changes in ambient temperature   
- Mild exacerbation   
	- airflow obstruction is unchanged to slightly increased   
- Severe exacerbation   
	- Worsening pulmonary gas exchange due to V/Q mismatch & Respiratory Muscle Fatigue   
	- Worsening pulmonary gas exchange   
		- airway inflammation, edema, mucous hypersecretion, and bronchoconstriction → reduce ventilation → hypoxic vasoconstriction of pulmonary arterioles → impairs perfusion   
	- Respiratory Muscle Fatigue + Alveolar hypoventilation   
		- Result in hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis → severe respiratory failure → death   
		- Hypoxia + Respiratory acidosis → pulmonary vasoconstriction → increase load on right ventricle + renal and hormonal changes → peripheral edema   
# History & Physical Exam/Clinical Features   
# Diagnosis   
## Consider COPD and Perform Spirometry if:   
   
- [Dyspnea](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/Index/Signs%20%26%20Symptoms/Dyspnea.md) -- progressive over time, worse with exercise, persistent   
- Chronic [Cough](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/Index/Signs%20%26%20Symptoms/Cough.md) -- may be intermittent and dry   
- Recurrent [Wheezing](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/Index/Signs%20%26%20Symptoms/Wheezing.md)   
- Chronic sputum   
- Recurrent respiratory infections   
- History of risk factors -- smoke or other noxious, occupational, genetics   
- Childhood factors -- prematurity, maternal smoking, low birth weight   
- Family history of COPD   
- Presence or absence of symptoms ([Wheezing](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/Index/Signs%20%26%20Symptoms/Wheezing.md), [Cough](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/Index/Signs%20%26%20Symptoms/Cough.md), sputum production or [Dyspnea](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/Index/Signs%20%26%20Symptoms/Dyspnea.md)) was not particularly discriminative in diagnosing COPD in the general population   
## GOLD Grades   
   
- Airflow limitation based on post-bronchodilator FEV₁   
	- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503113106.png)   
	- **Assess airflow limitation first then symptoms & risk of exacerbation**   
- FEV₁ and Mortality from NHANES 1 data   
	- Increasing mortality with increasing severity of airflow limitation   
	- Never smokers with moderate-severe COPD were not at increased risk of mortality   
## Symptom Assessment Tool   
### mMRC Dyspnea Scale   
   
- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503113302.png)   
   
### COPD Assessment Tool (CAT)   
   
- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503113324.png)   
- 8 items; scale 1-5   
- Scores 0 - 40   
	- <10 - Low impact   
	- 10-20 - Medium impact   
	- 21-30 - High impact   
	- >30 - Very high impact   
- Fixes limitation with predicting risk of acute exacerbation based on FEV₁   
- Assess symptoms plus consequences (activity limitation, sleep, fatigue, self-efficacy)   
## Additional Investigations to Consider   
   
- α-1 antitrypsin (AAT) screening   
	- WHO recommends screening all patients with COPD at least once   
- Imaging   
- Lung volumes and diffusing capacity   
- Oximetry and blood gas measurement   
- Exercise testing   
- Composite scores (such as BODE index for COPD survival)   
	- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503114500.png)   
	- B- **B**MI, O- degree of airflow **O**bstruction (FEV₁%), D-**D**yspnea (mMRC), E-**E**xercise capacity index (6MWT)   
	- BODE is a better predictor of risk of death from any cause and from respiratory causes than is the FEV₁ alone   
	- FEV₁ does not adequately reflect all the systemic manifestations of the disease   
		- FEV₁ correlates weakly with degree of dyspnea and change in FEV₁ does not reflect the rate of decline in patient's health   
	- Degree of dyspnea and health-status scores are more accurate predictors of risk of death than is the FEV₁.   
- Biomarkers -- need further study   
## Diagnosis of AECOPD   
   
# Management   
## Management of Stable COPD   
   
- Goals of COPD Management   
	- Reduce Symptoms   
		- relieve symptoms of dyspnea   
		- improve exercise tolerance   
		- improve health status   
	- Reduce Risk   
		- prevent disease progression   
		- prevent and treat exacerbations   
		- reduce mortality   
### Pharmacologic Therapy   
   
- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503130532.png)   
- Symptomatic patients with mild to moderate COPD (post-bronchodilator FEV₁ ≥50% predicted), there is significant improvement of annual decline in FEV₁ after bronchodilator use, accompanied by a significant increase in the time to first AECOPD, **but no improvement in mortality.**   
	- Improvement in prebronchodilator FEV₁ and post, mMRC and CAT scores   
- SABA and SAMA improve FEV₁ and symptoms   
	- SABA + SAMA > SABA or SAMA   
- LAMA and LABA improve lung function (FEV₁), dyspnea (symptoms), health status and exacerbations   
	- LAMA -- greater effect on exacerbation and hospitalization reduction   
	- LAMA -- improve effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation   
	- LAMA + LABA > LAMA or LABA   
- Inhaled Steroids   
	- ICS + LABA -- more effective than ICS or LABA in improving lung function, health status and exacerbations   
	- Triple inhaled therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA)   
		- improves lung function, symptoms, health status, exacerbations, mortality vs   
			- ICS/LABA or LABA/LAMA or LAMA   
	- Regular treatment with ICS increases risk of pneumonia, especially in those with severe disease   
	- Factors to consider when initiating ICS treatment   
		- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503122636.png)   
- Data   
	- ISOLDE Study (Burge PS, et al. BMJ. **2000**;320:1297)   
		- ICS (Fluticasone) decreases COPD exacerbation risk by 25%   
	- UPLIFT Study (Tashkin DP, et al. N Engl J Med. **2008**;359:1543)   
		- LAMA (Tiotropium) decreases COPD exacerbation risk by 14%   
	- TORCH Study (Calverley PM, et al. N Engl J Med. **2007**;356:775)   
		- LABA + ICS (Salmeterol + Fluticasone) decreases COPD exacerbation more than ICS or LABA alone   
	- POET-COPD Study (Vodelmeier et al. NEJM **2011**;364:1093)   
		- LAMA (Tiotropium) decreases exacerbations more than LABA (Salmeterol)   
	- FLAME Study (Wedzicha et al. NEJM **2016**; 374: 2222)   
		- LAMA + LABA (Glycopyrronium + Indacaterol) decreases exacerbations more than ICS + LABA (Fluticasone + Salmeterol)   
		- Effect independent of baseline blood eosinophil count   
		- Higher incidence of pneumonia in ICS group   
	- ETHOS Study (Rabe et al. NEJM **2020**; 383:35) -- looked at exacerbation rate   
		- Large study - 8509 patients with moderate to very severe COPD   
			- ≥1 moderate to severe exacerbation in prior year if FEV₁ <50%   
			- ≥2 moderate or ≥1 severe exacerbation if FEV₁ 50-65%   
		- ICS used was Budesonide 160 and 320   
		- Triple therapy with Budesonide 160 had lowest rate of moderate to severe exacerbation compared to triple therapy with Budesonide 320 and ICS + LABA and LAMA + LABA (highest rate) -- surprising that LAMA + LABA had a higher exacerbation rate than ICS + LABA when FLAME study said opposite (potentially a result of the individual drugs used?)   
	- IMPACT Study (Lipson et al. AJRCCM **2020**) -- looked at mortality   
		- Large study - 10355 patients with symptomatic COPD; FEV₁ <50% and at least 1 moderate to severe exacerbation in the prior year; FEV₁ 50 - <80% and at least 1 severe or 2 moderate exacerbations (a little higher cut off than ETHOS study)   
		- LAMA + LABA highest all-cause mortality   
		- ICS + LABA & triple therapy had similar all-cause mortality at the end of 52 weeks   
	- Macrolide Therapy in COPD & Exacerbations   
		- Long-term macrolide therapy reduces exacerbations (Seemungal et al. AJRCCM 2008)   
			- medium time to 1st exacerbation 271 days macrolide; 89 days for placebo   
		- Azithromycin therapy (Albert et al NEJM 2011; 365:689)   
			- medium time to exacerbation 266 days azithromycin; 174 days placebo   
	- Roflumilast & Exacerbations (Martinez et al Lancet 2015;385:857)   
		- All patients had baseline LABA/ICS use   
		- 13% reduction in exacerbations   
### Non-Pharmacologic Therapy   
   
- Smoking cessation   
	- Effect on Lung Function (The Lung Health Study at 11 years Anthonisen et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2002;166:675)   
		- Men who quit had an FEV₁ rate of decline of 30 mL/year   
		- Men who continued to smoke had an FEV₁ rate of decline of 66 mL/year   
	- Effect on Lung Function (The Lung Health Study at 14 years Anthonisen NR, et al. Ann Intern Med. 2005;142:233)   
		- Sustained quitters had the least deaths per 1000 person-years followed by intermittent quitters and highest deaths per 1000 person-years for continued smokers   
- Immunization   
	- Influenza vacciantion reduces serious illness and death in COPD patients   
	- PPSV 23 has been shown to reduce the incidence of CAP in    
		- COPD patients aged <65 years + FEV₁ <40% predicted   
		- Those with comorbidities   
	- PCV 13 demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing bacteremia and serious invasive pneumococcal disease in adults ≥65 years   
		- No longer recommended by CDC unless specific risk factors   
	- Tdap vaccination recommended in adults with COPD who were not vaccinated in adolescence to protect against pertussis   
- Pulmonary rehabilitation (Alison et al. Respirology 2017;22(4):800 McCarthy et al. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2015, Issue 2. Art. No.: CD003793)   
	- Significantly improves exercise capacity and health status (QOL/anxiety/depression/dyspnea)   
	- Reduces frequency of exacerbations   
	- Reduces the number of readmissions in the year following initiation   
	- Reduction in mortality   
	- Optimum benefit from programs 6-8 weeks' duration   
	- **does not improve pulmonary function tests or oxygenation**   
- Oxygen therapy   
	- Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) = >15 hours/day   
	- Severe chronic resting arterial hypoxemia (PaO₂ ≤55 mm Hg)   
		- Long-term oxygen therapy **improved survival** vs nocturnal-only or no oxygen   
	- Moderate chronic resting hypoxemia (PaO₂ 56-59 mm Hg or SpO₂ 88-90%) + cor pulmonale or polycythemia   
		- Long-term oxygen therapy **improved survival**   
	- Moderate chronic resting hypoxemia (SpO₂ 89-93%)   
		- Long-term oxygen therapy **does not** lengthen time to death or time to first hospitalization or provide sustained benefit in health status, lung function and 6MWT distance   
	- Exercise-Induced Hypoxemia (SpO₂ during 6MWT ≥80% for ≥5 minutes and <90% for ≥10 seconds)   
		- Long-term oxygen therapy **does not** lengthen time to death or time to first hospitalization or provide **sustained** benefit in health status, lung function and 6MWT distance   
			- Use of supplemental oxygen during exercise, however, increases exercise performance   
		- SpO₂ 80 to 88% during exercise (Moderate Exercise Hypoxemia), → O₂ during exercise did not improve long term outcomes of hospitalization, QOL, dyspnea   
			- Supplemental oxygen may remove the stimulus to hypoxia-compensating mechanisms such as those seen in residents of high-altitude   
	- Indications in Stable COPD   
		- Resting Hypoxemia   
			- PaO₂ ≤55 mm Hg or SaO₂ ≤88%   
			- PaO₂ ≤59 mm Hg or SaO₂ ≤ 89% +    
				- EKG evidence of cor pulmonale   
				- Hematocrit > 55   
				- Clinical evidence of right heart failure   
		- Exercise-Induced Hypoxemia   
			- PaO₂ ≤55 mm Hg during exercise (Severe Exercise Hypoxemia) → O₂ prescribed for use DURING exercise   
				- Unknown if this has any effect on long-term outcome benefits   
				- Use during exercise did not translate to improvement/benefit in dyspnea or ADLs when not using oxygen   
		- Sleep-Induced Hypoxemia   
			- PaO₂ ≤55 mm Hg during sleep → O₂ prescribed   
			- Also need to evaluate with PSG for underlying sleep-disordered breathing   
	- Supplemental oxygen sometimes provides symptomatic dyspnea relief by stimulating a decrease in minute ventilation → may improve activity but does not improve survival   
	- COPD + DOE can be from exertional hypoxemia but also from mechanical loading of the respiratory system, deconditioning and concomitant cardiac disease → pulmonary rehabilitation   
- Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation   
	- In stable hypercapnic COPD improves survival (Kohnlein et al. Lancet Respir Med 2014;2:698)   
	- Criteria: GOLD stage IV COPD + PaCO₂ ≥ 52 mm Hg & pH > 7.35   
	- Long-term NPPV targeted to reduce hypercapnia   
	- 11% reduction in mortality at 1 year   
	- In patients admitted for AECOPD requiring NIV and who remain hypoxemic and hypercarbic (PaCO₂ ≥52 mm Hg) 2 weeks following discharge, the addition of goal-directed **nocturnal NIV** to continous O₂ has been shown to significantly **prolong time to hospital readmission and death within 12 months** + improved health-related QOL and reduction in AECOPD frequency   
		- AECOPD + NIV = poor prognosis w/ median time to readmission or death less than a year   
			- benefit from supplemental oxygen   
			- use NIV for at least 6 hours at night → reduce nocturnal hypoventilation → reduction in daytime PaCO₂ by 6-8 mm Hg

	- Surgical Lung Volume Reduction (NETT research group NEJM 2003;348:2059 Naunheim et al. Ann Thorac Surg 2006; 82:431)   
		- Upper lobe emphysema a/w improvement in exercise capacity & QOL   
		- Upper lobe emphysema + low baseline exercise capacity a/w improvement in survival   
	- Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction w/ Endobronchial Valves (EBV) (Criner et al. AJRCCM 2018;198(9):1151 Kemp et al. AJRCCM 2017;196(12):1535 Majid et al. Respiration 2020;99(1):62)   
		- Criteria   
			- hyperinflation due to severe emphysema   
			- symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation   
		- EBV placed in lung region with most emphysematous destruction and **no collateral ventilation**   
		- Zephyr duckbill shaped and Spiration umbrella-shaped EBV approved in USA   
		- Efficacy -- **improved FEV₁, dyspnea, 6MWD, QOL, RV**   
		- A/E -- significant risk of pneumothorax (25-30%)   
		- EBV does not preclude subsequent LVRS or transplant

## Management of Acute Exacerbations   
   
- SABA with or without SAMA are recommended as initial bronchodilators   
- Systemic corticosteroids improve FEV₁, oxygenation and shorten recovery time and duration of hospitalization   
	- Duration of therapy no more than 5-7 days   
- Antibiotics if signs of bacterial infection   
	- shorten recovery time, reduce risk of early relapse and treatment failure, reduce hospital duration   
- Methylxanthines not recommended   
- NIV for AECOPD   
	- If no contraindication, NIV in patients with acute respiratory failure 2/2 AECOPD   
		- improves gas exchange   
		- reduces work of breathing   
		- reduces need for intubation   
		- reduces hospital duration and hospital re-admission   
		- improves survival   
# Complication & Prognosis   
   
- Diagnosed COPD   
	- Asymptomatic individuals with FEV₁ <80% (moderate or more severe obstruction) experience significant adverse events similar to symptomatic COPD   
- Undiagnosed COPD   
	- Symptomatic individuals with undiagnosed COPD were found to have an increased risk of exacerbations, pneumonia and death   
	- Asymptomatic individuals with undiagnosed COPD had an increased risk of exacerbations and pneumonia   
## Comorbidities ^4e379d   
   
- Heart failure - prevalence 20-70%   
- CAD - increased risk of MI for 30 days after acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB)   
	- COPD is an independent risk factor for CV disease   
		- increased the odds of having CV disease by 2.7   
		- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503115607.png)    
			- Finkelstein J, et al. Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis. 2009;4:337   
	- Effects of airflow obstruction and systemic inflammation are additive   
		- Increase in cardiac infarction injury score as airflow obstruction gets worse   
		- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503115800.png) (Sin    
			- DD & Man SF. Circulation 2003; 107: 1514   
- PVD - higher prevalence in COPD (8.8% vs 1.8%)   
- Osteoporosis - associated with emphysema, low BMI, low fat-free mass   
	- Severity of airflow obstruction predicts osteoporosis   
	- Worsening severity of airflow obstruction -> increasing percentage of osteoporosis   
		- More prominent in women than men   
- Metabolic syndrome - prevalence >30%   
- GERD - independent risk factor for exacerbations   
- OSA overlap with COPD a/w worse prognosis   
### Impact on Mortality   
   
- Estimated age-adjusted mortality a/w selected comorbid conditions   
- Holguin et al. CHEST 2005;128(4):2005 - National Hospital Discharge Survey 1979-2001; 47 million discharges   
- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503120027.png)   
	- Those with COPD and comorbid condition had higher in-hospital mortality from the percentage of people that were discharged   
### Frequent Exacerbations & Decline in Lung Function   
   
- More exacerbations = faster decline in lung function   
- Donaldson GC, et al. Thorax. 2002;57:847   
- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503121045.png)   
- PEFR recovery after exacerbation (Seemungal TA, et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2000;161:1608)   
	- Recovery of PEFR to baseline values was complete in only 75% of exacerbations at 35 day   
	- In 7% of exacerbations at 91 days PEFR recovery had not occurred   
### COPD Exacerbations Impact Survival   
   
- Severe COPD Exacerbations   
	- Soler-Cataluña JJ et al Thorax 2005;64:925   
	- 304 male patients, hospitalized for AECOPD followed for 5 years   
	- Risk of death 4.3 times greater in frequent exacerbators   
	- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/01.%20Obstructive%20Lung%20Disease/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220503121148.png)   
- In general exacerbations are a/w increased mortality   
	- In patients hospitalized with AECOPD   
		- 14% mortality in 3 months   
		- 28% mortality in 1 year   
	- If AECOPD w/ PaCO₂ > 50 mm Hg, a/w   
		- 33% mortality in 6 months   
		- 43% mortality in 12 months
