# General   
   
- Essentially a large group of disorders that affect the alveolar wall that potentially leads to diffuse scarring and fibrosis   
- Traditionally termed Interstitial Lung Disease however its a misnomer   
- The interstitium formally refers only to the region of the alveolar wall exclusive of and separating the alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells   
- But interstitial lung diseases affect all components of the alveolar wall: epithelial cell, endothelial cell, and cellular and noncellular components of the interstitium   
	- usually extends into the alveolar spaces so now its called diffuse parenchymal lung disease   
- Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias   
	- a group of pathologic entities that represent a subcategory of DPLD   
   
# Pathology   
   
- Two major pathologic components that occur simultaneously   
		- inflammatory process in the alveolar wall and alveolar spaces (sometimes called alveolitis)    
		- scarring or fibrotic process   
- Active inflammation is the primary process and fibrosis that follows is a secondary feature   
	- Exception: [Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/02.%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Lung%20Parenchyma/Diffuse%20Parenchymal%20Lung%20Disease/Idiopathic%20Interstitial%20Pneumonias/Chronic%20Fibrosing%20Interstitial%20Pneumonias/Idiopathic%20Pulmonary%20Fibrosis.md) in which the primary process is epithelial cell injury and fibrosis representing an abnormal repair of injury rather than alveolar inflammation   
- Active alveolitis   
	- Presence of a variety of inflammatory cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and plasma cells) that infiltrate the alveolar wall   
	- Types of DPLD may be a/w a prominence of a specific inflammatory cell type (e.g. eosinophils in Chronic Eosinophilic Pneumonia)   
	- In addition to the presence of these inflammatory cells, other pathologic characteristics are useful in the diagnosis of a specific pathologic entity   
		- For example: Granuloma   
			- Granuloma typically also has multinucleated giant cells which result from the fusion of several phagocytic cells into a single large cell with abundant cytoplasm and many nuclei   
			- Usually reflects an underlying immune process or reaction to a specific agent   
			- DPLD with Granulomas = [Sarcoidosis](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/02.%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Lung%20Parenchyma/Diffuse%20Parenchymal%20Lung%20Disease/Granulomatous%20Interstitial%20Lung%20Disease/Sarcoidosis.md) & [Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/02.%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Lung%20Parenchyma/Diffuse%20Parenchymal%20Lung%20Disease/Granulomatous%20Interstitial%20Lung%20Disease/Hypersensitivity%20Pneumonitis.md)   
				- Both have noncaseating granulomas

- The term idiopathic indicates that a specific etiologic agent has not been identified for these disorders but we now know that smoking plays a contributory role or adds to the risk of developing several of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonia   
- The terms used to describe the pathology and the associated clinical disorder may be different
