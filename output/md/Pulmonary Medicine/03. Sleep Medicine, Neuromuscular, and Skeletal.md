# Lung Disease and Sleep Disordered Breathing   
   
- Increase OSA prevalence in Asthma (2-6x more common in asthma)   
	- Less common by HST but likely because you can't actually measure sleep apnea in HST   
	- HST underestimates OSA prevalence   
- Prospective data that suggests that asthma was a risk factor for incidence of OSA (39%) 4 years later   
- Relationship with duration of asthma and development of OSA   
	- having asthma for >10 years was a/w highest risk for OSA development   
	- Therefore asthma in in of it self can develop OSA   
	- each 5 year increment of ...   
- Using ICS in a dose dependent fashion was a/w high OSA risk   
	- 5 fold increase risk   
	- How?   
		- ? ICS may lead to genioglossus dysfunction   
		- ? ICS may lead to fat deposition to the posterior oropharynx   
		- After  4months. increase protrusive strength of the tongue but cannot sustain this (decrease sustain)   
			- similar to untreated OSA patients   
			- increase in upper airway collapsibility during sleep   
			- increase fat accumulaton in the neck by 21% (measured by MRI)   
				- no weight gain in these subjects   
- ICS effects   
	- structural changesin the tongye (muscle fiber shifts, laminin) and neck (fat) whcih alter the uniform contraction and balanced co-activation of key muscle groups   
	- Tongue function and muscle fiber shifts - osa patients   
- Clinical implicaitons   
	- predispositon to collapse during sleep and potnetial delteriouss effects on other uaw functions   
- OSA shifts asthma phenotype to more non-eosinophilic   
- Apneas resulting in intrathoraicc pressure swings â†’ mechnical stress on the lower airways   
- Summary Asthma / OSA   
	- OSA-2.6x more common in asthma:   
	- HSS underestimate OSA prevalence   
	- IS use may contribute, apart from other disease-related features   
- OSA influences asthma control:   
	- Similar relationships with day- and night-time asthma control   
	- CPAP for OSA improves asthma control indices and QoL, but not FEV, (?remodeling)   
- Underlying mechanisms relate to OSA's features:   
- CIH:   
	- shifts the inflammation towards less eosinophilic, Th-1 pathways associated with tissue remodeling led to airways obstruction, which may be irreversible   
- Mechanical stress and sleep fragmentation may also contribute   
- OSA prevalence in IPF is high and often unrecognized   
- Symptoms and questionnaires have poor predictive ability in IPF   
- Potential improved survival in IPF with adherent CPAP treatment for OSA   
- OSA is highly common in IPF and largely unrecognized symptoms are not predictive of the diagnosis, thus, formal sleep evaluation should be considered   
- OSA relates with worse IPF outcomes and survival:   
	- in part, through a contribution to the RV dysfunction   
- OSA features (hypoxia, pressure swings) could affect various lung compartments (parenchyma, capillary bed), such that the combined effect is worse pulmonary & RV dysfunction, and gas exchange   
- Data are limited and larger/mechanistic studies are needed   
- Addressing OSA early offers a glimpse of hope in a disease with a grim prognosis
