- Obese patient (BMI >30) + PaCOâ‚‚ >45 mmHg while awake not due to other causes   
- Concomitant obstructive sleep apnea   
- Many have pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure   
- Implications on pulmonary function tests   
	- Lower functional residual capacity and expiratory reserve volume   
		- decreased total lung capacity, functional vital capacity, FEV1, maximum voluntary ventilation   
	- Worse in supine position   
	- Airway closure during exhalation   
	- Worsens V/Q mismatch and increased work of breathing   
	- Increased upper airway resistance   
	- Increased respiratory rate and decreased tidal volume is the pattern of breathing
