# Pneumonia due to Gram-Positive Bacteria   
## Pneumococcus   
## Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA & Community-Associated MRSA)   
## Other Gram-Positive Bacteria   
### Nocardiosis   
#### General   
   
- Agent   
	- Nocardia -- thin, delicate, gram positive **aerobic** actinomycete bacteria with beaded branching filaments that gives it a hyphae like appearance   
		- right angle branches   
		- Seven species a/w human disease   
			- N. nova, N. asteroids (Type VI) most common   
			- N. brasileinsis most commonly a/w mycetoma   
	- Not normal colonizers in the lung   
	- Very fastidious; weakly acid fast; negative PAS stain   
		- Romanowsky stain preferred   
	- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/05.%20Infections/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220506124950.png)   
		eosinophilic matrix → pink staining   
   
- Transmission   
	Inhalation in the lungs or less commonly directly into the skin after trauma   
		Other modes: ingestion or innoculation   
   
	- Dissemination occurs in approximately 50% of cases of pulmonary nocardiosis at the time of diagnosis   
- Risk factors   
	- Historically opportunistic disease   
		- 2/3 in immunocompromised patients -- impaired cell-mediated immunity such as HIV (CD4 <100), transplant recipients (especially lung transplant), malignancy (Lymphoma), or those on high-dose chronic steroids, Anti-TNF therapy (monoclonal > soluble)   
	- immunocompetent patients with underlying pulmonary disease (advanced COPD, bronchiectasis, PAP, granulomatous diseases)   
	- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/05.%20Infections/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220506130125.png)   
   
#### Clinical Manifestations   
   
- Can mimic blastomycosis (lung and skin lesions) or TB (upper-lobe cavitary lesions and weakly positive AFB)   
- Most common is subacute pneumonia   
- Clinical manifestations of pulmonary nocardiosis are variable and are related to whether the infection produces pneumonia, lung abscess, or cavity, and whether there is pleural involvement    
	- Other pulmonary manifestations may include pleural effusion, tracheitis, bronchitis, pleuropulmonary fistula, mediastinitis, pericarditis and sinusitis   
- Chest x-ray -- dense mass like lingular infiltrate   
- High tropism for CNS -- **headaches**, fever, FND, seizures -> early imaging is paramount -> brain abscess   
- Often systemic with more than 2 sites involved -- i.e. extrapulmonary dissemination common   
	- 50% of pulmonary nocardiosis disseminate to CNS   
	- All immunocompromised patients with nocardia infection should have a brain CT or MRI as should those with immunocompetence and anything other than cutaneous disease   
		- 40% have silent dissemination   
	- Severe nocardiosis -- pulmonary disease with dissemination including the CNS   
	- Other locations -- skin, bone, muscle   
	- More common in patients with HIV and alcoholism   
- Radiographic Manifestations   
	- Airspace consolidation common   
	- Most common feature is cavitation   
	- Nodules seen more with Nocardia   
#### Diagnosis   
   
- Due to the nodules, masses and cavitation it is often confused with malignancy, rhodococcus equi, aspergillus   
- Can often culture; may need bronchoscopy to get good specimens   
	- culture need to be incubated aerobically for up to 4 weeks   
- If smear is positive + immunocompromised patient => disease   
- Can get PCR to speed up the diagnosis   
   
#### Management   
   
- IV empiric antibiotics -- 2 or 3 agents   
	TMP/Sulfa   
   
	- Amikacin   
	- Linezolid   
	- Imipenem   
	- Ertapenem   
- Mild to Moderate pulmonary nocardiosis -- TMP-SMX   
	- resistance more common in patients with underlying lung disease   
- Severe pulmonary nocardiosis and/or CNS involvement -- IV TMP-SMX + Amikacin or with the addition of imipenem for CNS disease   
- Immunocompromised + moderate to severe pulmonary nocardiosis without CNS -> IV TMP-SMX + Amikacin OR imipenem + Amikacin   
- Switch to high-dose oral after 3 to 6 weeks of IV therapy depending on response and sensitivity results   
- Because therapy may need to be extended **(6 to 12 months or more)**, resistance is common, and recurrence is frequent despite drugs appropriately selected based on sensitivity patterns, obtaining infectious disease consultation to assist in patient management is encouraged   
	- Do 2 drugs up front until susceptibility is known especially if its severe disease   
- If sulfa allergy -> desensitization or minocycline   
   
#### Mortality Risk Factors   
   
- Independent risk factors   
	- Age > 68   
	- Pulmonary aspergillosis   
	- Resistance to TMP/SMX   
   
### Actinomycosis   
#### General   
   
- Agent   
	- Actinomyces israelii -- gram positive filamentous **anaerobic** bacterium   
	- Acute angles   
	- easily seen on Pap smear   
		- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/05.%20Infections/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220506125033.png)   
			- Thinner than fungal infections (like aspergillus)   
- Reservoir   
	- normally colonizes in the mouth → aspiration → pneumonia   
		- other locations: colon, vagina   
		- Therefore extension of disease from abdominal cavity or neck can occur   
- Transmission   
- Risk Factors   
	- Most infections occur in normal hosts   
	- M > F 3:1   
#### Clinical Manifestations   
   
- Given that the reservoir is in the mouth can be seen initially with an infection of the cervicofacial region that invades into the mediastinum   
	- Cervicofacial actinomycosis   
		- Risk factors -- dental caries, gingivitis, DM, immunosuppression, malnutrition, bisphosphonate use and local tissue damage caused by tumor or radiation therapy   
		- Cervicofacial collections may manifest overlying bluish or reddish discoloration and cutaneous fistulization may occur, with drainage of thick yellow exudate with characteristic sulfur granules   
			- ![](../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/05.%20Infections/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220506125115.png)   
				- Sulfur granule surrounded by the proteinaceous material   
- Bronchocutaneous fistula highly suggestive   
- Often confused with lung cancer and TB   
- Microscopy   
	- AFB negative   
	- PAS negative   
- Radiographic Manifestations   
	- CT shows patchy airspace consolidation a/w pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy   
	- **Multiple fistulae**   
		- Lung abscess → empyema → osteomyelitis of ribs → chest wall sinus tract formation   
	- Pleural disease + adenopathy   
	- Tend to be in periphery and lower lung fields   
	- Most common feature is **cavitation**   
- Histology   
	- Sulfur granules   
		- hard, yellow concretions that are aggregates of mycelial fragments and visible to the naked eye or with low-power microscopy   
   
#### Management   
   
- Untreated = fatal   
- Prolonged therapy needed   
- Penicillins   
	- Usually Zosyn   
- If allergic to penicillins -> tetracyclines, clindamycin or erythromycin   
- Agents with penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins such as oxacillin, fluoroquinolones, metronidazole, aminoglycosides, aztreonam, and sulfonamides are poor against Actinomyces
