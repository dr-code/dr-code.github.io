# Introduction   
   
- Main function of lungs = bring atmospheric air into contact with blood   
- ventilation = moving gas in and out of the lungs   
- respiration = moving O₂ and CO₂ between air and blood   
- conducting airways = those airways that provide a pathway to the gas-exchange membrane of the lungs   
	- do not participate in gas exchange   
	- in transit → gas is warmed, humidified and filtered by the [Upper Airways](../../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/11.%20Respiratory%20Anatomy%20%26%20Physiology/11.01.%20The%20Airways%20%26%20Alveoli/11.01.1.%20The%20Airways.md#^646d68)   
# Upper Airways   
^646d68   
   
- consists of the nose, oral cavity, pharynx and larynx   
- larynx marks the separation of upper and lower airways   
## Nose   
   
- function = filter and condition air   
- more resistance than airflow through mouth   
	- most breath through their nose at rest   
- swollen mucous membranes = high nasal resistance | exercise = rapid breathing   
	- both cases → switch to mouth breathing   
- structures that increase airflow resistance in nose are necessary to filter and condition air   
- Nasal cavity divided into two channels called nasal fossae   
	- done by cartilaginous anterior portion of the nasal septum   
- Posterior nasal septum formed by the vomer and ethmoid bones   
- Two nasal fossae lead posteriorly → common chamber called nasopharynx   
	- through opening called choanae   
		- three of them that are downward-sloping, scrolled-shaped bones   
		- project from lateral walls of nasal cavity toward the nasal septum   
		- ![](../../../Pulmonary%20Medicine/11.%20Respiratory%20Anatomy%20%26%20Physiology/11.01.%20The%20Airways%20%26%20Alveoli/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220428112750.png)   
		- They create three passages: superior meatus, middle meatus and inferior meatus   
		- Because they create turbulence of air, they are often called turbinates   
		- Increases surfaces area of the nasal cavity   
		- The maxilla forms the anterior 3/4ths of the nasal cavity floor → called hard palate   
			- cartilaginous structures form the posterior 1/4th → called soft palate   
			- During swallowing or coughing, the soft palate closes this posterior opening of the nasal cavity isolating the nasal cavity from the oral cavity *(similar to the epiglottis in the pharynx)*   
- The nasal septum is often deflected to one side or the other (L > R), making it more difficult to get a catheter or artificial airway in on that side.   
### Histology   
   
- Anterior 1/3 of the nose → squamous, nonciliated epithelium   
- Posterior 2/3 of the nose (including turbinates) → pseudostratified, ciliated,
