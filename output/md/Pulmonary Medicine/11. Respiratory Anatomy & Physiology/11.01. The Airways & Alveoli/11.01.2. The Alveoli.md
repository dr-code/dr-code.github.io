# General   
   
- Appearance of alveoli marks the beginning of the respiratory, or gas-exchanging, zone.   
- Alveoli first appear in the respiratory bronchioles   
- The distance from the beginning to the end of the acinus is only a few millimeters but most of the lung's volume is contained in the acinar structures (~3000 mL at rest)
