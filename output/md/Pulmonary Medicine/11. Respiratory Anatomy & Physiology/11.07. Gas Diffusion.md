Diffusion = main method of gas movement in the distal small airways and of gas exchange in the alveoli   
   
- Gas exchange is dependent on several factors   
	- Intact alveolar-capillary membrane   
	- Partial pressure of the gas diffusing between the two compartments   
	- Time that individual red blood cells spend in the capillary bed to allow for complete gas exchange at the interface   
		- The rate of oxygen binding to the hemoglobin molecule is nonlinear and increases with each individual oxygen molecule bound   
		- This maintains the maximal pressure gradient between the oxygen in the alveoli and the partial pressure of oxygen dissolved in plasma â†’ very efficient transfer across alveolar-capillary membrane   
		- In a normal patient this time is 2-3x that which is required to completely upload oxygen, therefore, diffusion is rarely impaired
